# NoteTakeApp

The NoteApp is communication with NoteTakeAPI which the API is integrated with Azure Ad directory GraphAPI to allow create edit and Save Note on OneDrive.

Running the App Locally:
Clone the App
RUN : npm install
      ng build 
      ng serve to start the application



NB: Need to make sure the NoteTakeApi is running also to be able sent requests like creating Note or getting Note through EndPoints.
